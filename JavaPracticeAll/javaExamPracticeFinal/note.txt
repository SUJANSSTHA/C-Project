what is class and object?
Class is a group of elements having properties and behaviours. it s a blueprint of object. It is virtal part it doesnot exit in real. In class we can make logic.

type of class 

user-define class
pre-defined class

example of pre-define class
system class 
string class
Scanner class


what is Constructor ? 
Constructor is a Special type of method whose name is same as class name.



note 
the main purpose of constructor is initialize the object
Every java class has a constructor
A constructor is autometically called at the time of object creation.
A constructor never contain any return type including void

type   of constructor 
    Private constructor
    Defalut constructor
    prametrized constructor
    copy constructor

    Defalut constructor
    A constructor which does not have any parameter is called default constructor.

    syntex 
    class A{
        A()
        {

        }
    }

    A Parameteized constructor 

    A constructor through which we can pass more the one parameters is called parametrized constructor.

    syntex:-
    class A{
        A(int x, String y)
        {

        }
    }

what is copy constructor ?
    When ever we pass obejct reference to the constructorthen it is called copy constructor.


what is private constructor ?
     In Java it is possible to write a constructor as a private but according to the rule we can't access private member outside of class.

syntex 
class cls{
    private cls()
    {

    }
}

super keyword
    Super keyword refers to the objct of super class, it is used when we want to call the super clas variable, constructor, method through sub object.

Note:-
    Super
        1. Variable 
        2. method 
        3. constructor

this keyword
    this keyword refers to the current object inside a method or constructor.


Encapsulation 
Encapsulation is a mechanism throughwhich we can binding the data members and member methdo in a single unit.
